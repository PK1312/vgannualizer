#Video Game Franchise Annualizer  

This is a silly satirical thing I built while I still [blogged about games](http://www.siliconsasquatch.com/). It's something like five years old now, so I'm not sure how useful it is (or how topical the references are), but [the domain's gonna expire soon](http://videogameannualizer.com/) and I'd hate to forget about it.
