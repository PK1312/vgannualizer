#Video Game Franchise Annualizer  

This is a silly satirical thing I built while I still [blogged about games](http://www.siliconsasquatch.com/). It's something like five years old now, so I'm not sure how useful it is (or how topical the references are), but [the domain's gonna expire soon](http://videogameannualizer.com/) and I'd hate to forget about it.  

##How it works  

The formula is pretty simple and laid out in the app.js comments. Certain term types are always used; others are less common. Some franchises will crash and burn early (we call these "Bloodraynes"), but a few will make it into the double digits before expiring (the "Final Fantasy"s of the world).

##Ideas for future development  

I'm thinking about optionally generating fake Metacritic scores and review blurbs, but I'm not sure if the joke will be funny long enough for me to do all that.
